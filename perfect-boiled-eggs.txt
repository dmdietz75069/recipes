Perfect Boiled Eggs

This recipe makes hard boiled eggs which are easy to peel and are not over or under cooked.

N eggs (up to you < dozen)
water 
1 teaspoon of vinegar
ice water

Choose a pot with lid large enough to store all the eggs in a layer or two (not more) with only half of the height of the pot used.  Add vinegar and enough cold water to cover the eggs by an inch with an couple inches to spare from the top of the pot.  Bring water with eggs to a boil.  Boil on medium-high heat for 4 minutes.  Turn off heat and put on lid and let sit for 10 minutes without further heat.  Drain all the hot water adding cold water to sink while draining water (to prevent pipes from melting).  Add ice water to the eggs creating an ice bath.  Take out each egg as soon as they can be handled and gently crack the shells around the surface and put them back in the ice bath.  After another 10 minutes, peel the eggs and rinse them once the shells appear gone.
